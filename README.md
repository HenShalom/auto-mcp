Transform any OpenAPI/Swagger definition into a fully-featured **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server ‚Äì ready to run locally, inside Claude Desktop, or in the cloud.

The service reads a Swagger (OpenAPI v2) document, generates routes on-the-fly, proxies requests to the upstream endpoint you configure, and exposes them through MCP using either the **STDIO** or **SSE** transport defined in the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).
